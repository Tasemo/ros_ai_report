\chapter{Conclusion}
* test accuracy very good with provided test data
* length is really important for training, original data is aligned and even padded with zeroes so that all have the same length,
that is not the case for the data coming from the microphone, 
* amplitude is also important, maybe its training on that as well
* the model took the waveform at specifc times into consideration, not fully based on the overall structure of the wave
