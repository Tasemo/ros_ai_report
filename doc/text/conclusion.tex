\chapter{Conclusion}
* test accuracy very good with provided test data
* length is really important for training, original data is aligned and even padded with zeroes so that all have the same length,
that is not the case for the data coming from the microphone, 
* amplitude is also important, maybe its training on that as well
* the model took the waveform at specifc times into consideration, not fully based on the overall structure of the wave
* noise does not effect the prediction too much if it is relativly constant

\section{Future Work}
More work has to be done on transforming the data to the format the model was trained on. It is simply not enough to feed it audio data with
a different amplitude and a different timing. The high fluctuation in accuracies should be evaluated in more detail as well as no conclusive reason for that
was found in this report.
