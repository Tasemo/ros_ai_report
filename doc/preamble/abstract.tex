This project looks at the feasibility of a command recognition system using machine learning and specificly with convolutional neural networks. It 
performs a detailed evaluation on provided test data and also a more realistic test on a real microphone. It also describes the challenges needed
to overcome during its implementation and how such a system could be built.
